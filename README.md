# Orbite
This programs lets you simulate points rotating around each other using Tkinter, Python. This was made in 2021.

## Overall presentation
The main window contains the canvas and the different commands. Using them, you can create new points in a new frame. Those points have various attributes such as what other point they rotate around, the radius, the function used...
By default, points rotate in a circle but you can write a custom function.
Visually, you can draw a point's tail, in various colors and sizes.

## Panel
The panel and the shell have an entry to input Python commands. The shell prints out the outputs.
For each point, you get access to its angle and coordinates, relative to the canvas and to the point's center.
You can change the speed and the tail's size.
'position' is the position in the panel, based on Tkinter's grid method.
